# XGBoost Min, Day for Building

## Overview
This project utilizes XGBoost and various data science libraries to analyze and build predictive models. The notebook processes data, visualizes insights, and evaluates model performance using machine learning techniques.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- xgboost
- warnings (built-in)

Alternatively, install them individually with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load data, process it, and build models.
3. Visualize results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
